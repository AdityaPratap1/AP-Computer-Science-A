PROJECT TITLE: 2.02 Arithmetic Calculations
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To understand the importance of order of operations and be able to execute problems in JAVA.
VERSION or DATE: 10/29/2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Pratap, Ady
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
DEVELOPER COMMENTS: This project was a good way to practice data types and their uses (int and double). One way to make the source code more 
                    readable is by not copying all the code into all the classes instead by defining methods in different classes and combine them in one class.
                    The Calculationsv1-4 had all the code from the begining instead the specific changes (which was included but everything was copied as 
                    well).
