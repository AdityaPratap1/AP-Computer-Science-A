PROJECT TITLE:3.06 Strings
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the use of several methods of the String class.
VERSION or DATE: 11/11/2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Pratap, Ady
PMR: For this project, i chose the phrase "i don't know what you are talking about because you are texting in java" because it very much suits my position in this course and the last
      replace() phrase is "You know what? I learnt JAVA and now, I understand everything! Honestly, it took me forEVER" and hopefully this will be the position I will be in at 
      the end of the course. As far as String methods go, I followed all the instructions and kept it straightforward. Therre weren't any problems i encountered.
