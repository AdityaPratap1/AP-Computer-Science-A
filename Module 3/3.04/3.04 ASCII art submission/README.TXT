PROJECT TITLE: ASCII Art
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:The purpose of this program is to show ASCII art using escape sequences.
VERSION or DATE: 11/10/2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS:Pratap, Ady
PMR: For this project, I chose to do a cat as my ASCII art because it was simple yet very suitable for this project. 
     I used some random charectars and some closely chosen ones like 'A' for the ears. There was only one problem I
     ran into and that was using print() instead of println(). Every one of my rows, afetr the first compile, appear
     side by side instead of one below another to make the complete cat. I soon realised that I can use the '\n' 
     escape charectar to fix the problem.
